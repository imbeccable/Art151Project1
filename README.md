# Art151Project1
The canvas is divided into two, the left side and the right side.
If the mouse is on the left side, the blocks will bounce around in that half,
and if the mouse is on the right side, they'll bounce around in the other half.
This qualifier is based on the window size.
The blocks will rapidly change colors randomly as they're moving across the screen.
The background starts as a black screen, but if the "enter" key is pressed,
the two sides will randomly change colors and will briefly clear the screen
of blocks.
If the "esc" key is pressed, the page will reset with there being no blocks
and the background being black.
